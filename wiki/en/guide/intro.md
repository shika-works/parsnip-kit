# What is Parsnip-Kit?

Parsnip-Kit is a zero-dependency, multi-functional, modular JavaScript utility library that supports TypeScript.

It provides a wide range of utility functions covering type checking, arrays, objects, strings, functions, asynchronous operations, numbers, statistics, and random numbers, meeting most development needs and reducing boilerplate code in our applications while increasing maintainability.

Written using modern JavaScript APIs, Parsnip-Kit supports TypeScript types for all utility functions, offering developers a refreshing experience whether they are developing applications or reading the source code.

# Overview

Here's an overview of the tool functions provided by Parsnip-Kit:
- Object: For manipulating JavaScript objects, such as [cloneDeep](../object/cloneDeep), [isEqual](../object/isEqual), [getByPath](../object/getByPath).
- Array: For manipulating arrays, such as [unique](../array/unique), [intersection](../array/intersection), [lexSort](../array/lexSort) and [numberSort](../array/numberSort).
- Statistic: For descriptive statistics in JavaScript, including [sum](../statistic/sum), [maxItem](../statistic/maxItem) and [minItem](../statistic/minItem).
- Number: For processing numbers, such as [range](../number/range), [thousandSeparator](../number/thousandSeparator) and [percent](../number/percent).
- Function: Functions for handling function parameters, returns, and logic, such as: [debounce](../function/debounce), [throttle](../function/throttle), [combine](../function/combine) and [curry](../function/curry).
- Async: Focused on asynchronous process handling, such as [concurrent](../async/concurrent), [retry](../async/retry) and [asyncForEach](../async/asyncForEach).
- String: String tool functions, such as [camelCase](../string/camelCase), [snakeCase](../string/snakeCase) and [htmlEncode](../string/htmlEncode).
- Typed: For checking the type of input parameters, including [isPrimitive](../typed/isPrimitive), [isNanValue](../typed/isNanValue) and [getTypeTag](../typed/getTypeTag).
- Random: Generates random data, including [randomNumber](../random/randomNumber), [randomString](../random/randomString) and [randomFromArray](../random/randomFromArray).
